Obviously you'll want to be in the snow packed high country for the best places to see.  Unless you're around a ski resort you'll be blissfully alone winter camping.  Bring some warm closths and lots of layers.  The respective gear you should have will be a snow shovel, water proof matches, snow shoes and ice grips for your boots.</p>\n        <p> One word of warning, you never want to make camp under a tree.  This is because when you light a fire, the rising heat will melt the snow in the branches and before long you'll be buried under a half melted pile of no fun.</p>\n        <h2> Now for your Beverage!</h2>\n        <p> The winter months are best accented by a strong hoppy beer in my opinion... or a schnapps & hot chocolate mix.  Either way, you're going to have a good time.</p>\n        </div>\n\n    </body>\n</html>"]],"start1":0,"start2":0,"length1":0,"length2":1150}]],"length":1150}
